# Third Person Camera
An enhanced third person camera for GZDoom that allows for more modern features over the basic chase cam. Includes:
* Range customization options for moving the camera's position
* Basic support for blended palette flashes
* Independent character rotation to allow for full visibility of the sprite while playing
* Multiplayer and cutscene support
Note that line portal support is limited due to some issues with properly moving the camera through them.

To activate, bind the toggle camera key under the camera options menu.
